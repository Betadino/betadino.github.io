**Work**

This project, was a progression from 2nd year implementation of Marching Cubes, where i did the algorithm implementation.

This implementation is a cave generator that uses a cellular automaton to manipulate a cubic array of booleans as structural data, then, the marching cubes algorithm creates itâ€™s mesh.

In the last semester it was proposed to approach a topic for scientific study and i opted to study this to find the most eficient form to use this with the aesthetic i need, as i want to use it in a future game i have planned for mobile platforms.

In practical terms, this brought the challenge to implement marching tetrahedrons as a comparison, and this is the project i built to make such comparison.

It is made in Unity/C#

### My Journey as a Programmer

During my second year at university, I was honored to be invited by the faculty to participate in a significant project as a programmer. It was an exceptional opportunity that allowed me to contribute my skills in various aspects:

**Accomplished Work:**

- **Front End and Middleware Development:** Implemented the entire front end and middleware in React, including interactions and the integration of UX design elements.
- **Translation of Functions:** Adapted bilateral JavaScript functions from React to C# for WebGL in Unity.
- **Core Functionalities:** Developed essential functionalities within the Unity environment.

Additionally, I proposed the use of React for the interface part, as the initial idea of implementing a traditional web interface inside Unity didn't make any sense. This decision proved to be efficient and effective for the project.

Through this experience, I learned how to communicate and handle WebGL with React and how they integrate seamlessly.

This experience not only honed my technical skills but also enriched my understanding of collaborative project development.

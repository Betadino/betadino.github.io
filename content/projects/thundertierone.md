This is my final university project made with 2 colleagues that worked level design, art and animation.

 
Roles: **Producer** | **Game Designer** | **Sound Designer** | **Main Programmer**

This project is a Mod campaign of zombies, made through the Thunder Tier One Modding Tool . **[Check it out on Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3374103336)**.


We had the formal support from Krafton Portugal to assist in any questions we've had and it has currently 3 of the 5 projected missions released.


### Roles

**Producer:** 
- Managed timelines, and ensured clear direction of development within the team.

**Game Designer:** 
- Conceptualized the main idea and directed the making of the campaign, always incorporating and discussing ideas from all team members that increased quality of the mod.

**Sound Designer:** 
- Created and integrated sound effects and managed audio assets.

**Main Programmer:** 
- I was responsible for all the programming part of the game including scripting the levels, bosses and AI behaviours.

Accomplished Work:
Front End and Middleware Development: Implemented the entire front end and middleware in React, including interactions and the integration of UX design elements. Translation of Functions: Adapted bilateral JavaScript functions from React to C# for WebGL in Unity. Core Functionalities: Developed essential functionalities within the Unity environment. Additionally, I proposed the use of React for the interface part, as the initial idea of implementing a traditional web interface inside Unity didn’t make any sense.

<p>During my second year at university, I was honored to be invited by the faculty to participate in a significant project as a programmer. It was an exceptional opportunity that allowed me to contribute my skills in various aspects:</p>
<p><strong>Accomplished Work:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Front End and Middleware Development:</strong> Implemented the entire front end and middleware in React, including interactions and the integration of UX design elements.</li>
<li><strong>Translation of Functions:</strong> Adapted bilateral JavaScript functions from React to C# for WebGL in Unity.</li>
<li><strong>Core Functionalities:</strong> Developed essential functionalities within the Unity environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, I proposed the use of React for the interface part, as the initial idea of implementing a traditional web interface inside Unity didn&rsquo;t make any sense. This decision proved to be efficient and effective for the project.</p>
<p>Through this experience, I learned how to communicate and handle WebGL with React and how they integrate seamlessly.</p>
<p>This experience not only honed my technical skills but also enriched my understanding of collaborative project development.</p>
